## Recent activities
- Aside from my research on Automatic Speech Recognition, I launched a reading group to gather members of GalsenAI that are interested in the research part of Deep Learning model, and offer researchers a space to communicate and discuss around subjects that interest them . GalsenAI is in my opinion the most active AI Association in Senegal. You can find a video of our first session  [here](https://youtu.be/-VOG2esUc6I).

## my year 2022



As a lecturer/researcher: 
- I joined African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS) and the African Master of Machine Intelligence as Post-doctoral Researcher. 

- I gave a lecture on Image Processing and Computer Vision at Université virtuelle du Sénégal (UVS). 

- I was a speaker at the IndabaX Senegal where I talked about adversarial examples. 

As an ML/DL enthusiast who enjoys interacting with other enthusiasts: 
- I participated to the Kaggle Days , my first in-person since the pre-covid era. The learning experience was amazing, plus I had the opportunity to attend talks from and speak with some Kaggle Grand Masters. 

- I also served as a mentor for the ML Study Jam organized by GalsenAI to help people learn more about Machine Learning/Deep Learning. 

- I have been granted NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute Ambassadorship, that is a great step for my goal of making Deep Learning accessible to more people. 

- I contributed to the translation of the Hugging Face course from English to French. My first contribution to open-source project, the first of many more I hope.
