## Recent activities
- Aside from my research on Automatic Speech Recognition, I launched a reading group to gather members of GalsenAI that are interested in the research part of Deep Learning model, and offer researchers a space to communicate and discuss around subjects that interest them . GalsenAI is in my opinion the most active AI Association in Senegal. You can find a video of our first session  [here](https://youtu.be/-VOG2esUc6I).

## My year 2025

## [My year 2024](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ismailaseck_2024-was-one-of-my-busiest-years-aside-from-activity-7285210227879084034-aZVz?utm_source=social_share_send&utm_medium=member_desktop_web&rcm=ACoAABcDnBkBR4CAwhmoLM76GyiNwsNK5-8Frvg)
2024 was one of my busiest years. Aside from my Lengo AI adventure, and my activities at GalsenAI, we launched AI Hub Senegal, an initiative that is federating the actors of the Senegalese Artificial Intelligence ecosystem. A very important in our shared journey to democratize Artificial Intelligence. Here is a sample of my activities during 2024: 

- Lengo AI was feature in Jeune Afrique as one of the 20 Future Champions of Tech: [https://lnkd.in/eXXtRzTB](//lnkd.in/eXXtRzTB). 

- Co-authored a paper published in Transaction on Machine Learning Research (TMLR) with Eugene Ndiaye and Matthew Lau: [https://lnkd.in/eyWseE8h](https://lnkd.in/eyWseE8h).

- Attended NeurIPS again, 7 years after my first attendance, and got the chance to connect in-person with Jonas NGNAWE, Awa Dieng, and Marieme NGOM to name a few. The Black in AI workshop was an opportunity to strengthen the connection to actors of some other African countries AI ecosystem.

- Attended the Deep Learning Indaba for the 2nd time in a row. This edition was special since it was the time that Senegal hosted that event. I got the opportunities to be a panelist in two different panels. I was a keynote speaker and/or panelist at the IndabaX Senegal, IndabaX Congo üá®üá¨ and at IndabaX Chad (by Chad AI Network). 

- Was a speaker at the AMLD Africa in Nairobi Kenya.

- Organized a Machine Learning Study Jam, a month long program to learn/revisiting the fundamentals of Machine Learning, and run it with Rokhaya Diagne and A√Øm√©rou Ndiaye. We manage to get 30% of women of the registration with the help of WiMLDS Dakar. 

- A√Øm√©rou Ndiaye and I also run an in-person training on the "Fundamentals of Deep Learning" and manage to get 50+ participants to be certified from NVIDIA on a single Saturday . I reached the Silver Tier of the Certified Instructor as I run in total 3 workshop (online and in-person) and manage to get 90+ participants certified. 

- Spent more than 100 hours teaching and supervising AI project at Ecole Superieure Multinationale des Telecommunications (ESMT Dakar) and Universit√© num√©rique Cheikh Hamidou KANE (UN-CHK). 

- Made an appearance at Edtech Mondays on TV5 to talk about at the initiatives the AI Hub Senegal to promote the AI Ecosystem.


## [My year 2023](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ismailaseck_galsenai-lengoai-dlrl-activity-7153372750835830784-CxmL?utm_source=social_share_send&utm_medium=member_desktop_web&rcm=ACoAABcDnBkBR4CAwhmoLM76GyiNwsNK5-8Frvg)
2023 was a special year for me. Two entities greatly participated in that [Lengo AI](https://www.linkedin.com/company/lengoai/posts/?feedView=all) and [GalsenAI](https://www.linkedin.com/company/galsen-ai/?viewAsMember=true). 
I joined the admin board of [GalsenAI](https://www.linkedin.com/company/galsen-ai/?viewAsMember=true) with the ambition to gather people sharing passion about AI and research paper around AI. I also happened to state that there should be a before 2023 and an after 2023 for GalsenAI, so far so good. 
I joined LengoAI as CTO and Co-founder and participated in a successful pre-seed fundraising where we raised 1 million+$.

This year, I renewed with attending gatherings where AI was discussed as participant, panelist and teaching. In all cases, I did learn and did enjoy that. I attended the #DLRL Summer School in Montreal, the AfricArena AI Summit in Tunis, the Deep Learning Indaba and the Google for Startups graduation in Accra. I met wonderful people during those events, some I knew only virtually prior to those events. 

The things I am the most proud are:


1- Trying to be the best collaborator with all my collaborators. 


2- Participating in the making of the hashtag#SNAI the Senegalese National Artificial Intelligence Strategy.


3- Serving the GalsenAI community especially allowing them to get the NVIDIA Fundamentals of Deep Learning certification in my quality of Nvidia Deep Learning Institute Certified Instructor. 

## My year 2022
As a lecturer/researcher: 
- I joined African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS) and the African Master of Machine Intelligence as Post-doctoral Researcher. 

- I gave a lecture on Image Processing and Computer Vision at Universit√© virtuelle du S√©n√©gal (UVS). 

- I was a speaker at the IndabaX Senegal where I talked about adversarial examples. 

As an ML/DL enthusiast who enjoys interacting with other enthusiasts: 
- I participated to the Kaggle Days , my first in-person since the pre-covid era. The learning experience was amazing, plus I had the opportunity to attend talks from and speak with some Kaggle Grand Masters. 

- I also served as a mentor for the ML Study Jam organized by GalsenAI to help people learn more about Machine Learning/Deep Learning. 

- I have been granted NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute Ambassadorship, that is a great step for my goal of making Deep Learning accessible to more people. 

- I contributed to the translation of the Hugging Face course from English to French. My first contribution to open-source project, the first of many more I hope.
